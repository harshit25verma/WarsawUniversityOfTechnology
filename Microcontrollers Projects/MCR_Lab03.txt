Assignment 3
Implement a motor controller, which allows for control over a linear stage with a stepper motor drive. 
Use two types of user interfaces: - - 
buttons from the development board for changing the movement direction (left/right) and 
stopping the stage 
serial connection with the PC for transmitting information about the state of operation (e.g., 
“moving left”, “moving right”, “stopped”) from the MCU to the PC, and the same serial link for 
transmitting stage speed settings from the PC to the MCU (using single characters from ‘0’ to 
‘9’, where ‘0’ corresponds to the lowest speed, and ‘9’ to the greatest).
